What is PyPI?
=============

PyPI stands for the **Py**\ thon **P**\ ackage **I**\ ndex. It is pronounced
as either *PIE-P-I* or *PIE-PEE*, not *PIE-PIE* (which means PyPy, the
interpreter).

Also called the **Cheeseshop**. This is an inside joke referencing the
same-named sketch of Monty Python’s Flying Circus.

Seriously, what is PyPI
=======================

A server running in Guido’s bedroom [#]_ to host all of Python’s third-party
packages.

.. [#] Just kidding. It is sponsored by Rackspace IIRC.

Your computer sends requests to it when you ``pip install`` (by default).

Currently located at https://pypi.python.org.
